AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain with multiple five-star properties across India, has been in the hospitality industry for over 20 years. Recently, they've faced declining market share and revenue due to competition and ineffective decision-making. To turn things around, they've opted to leverage Business and Data Intelligence, hiring a 3rd party provider to analyze their historical data and provide actionable insights to help them regain their market position.

The challenge was to create a dash board for Revenue management team which helps them to take decisions in their business.

This project started with detail understanding about the problem statement and hospitality domain. How key performance indicators for hospitality plays a key role in understanding key insights.
